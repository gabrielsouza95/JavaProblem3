the owner will manage it. He is your friend so he asks you to make a system 
that will resume the orders information and display to the customers as required. 
He will take each client order in a list that follows the specific rules

    The first line will have the number N of dishes noted by the waiter;
    The second line will have the number P of people in the table;
    The next N lines will have the name of the dish and the price of it;

Dish1 15
Dish3 7
Dish1 15
Dish8 20
Dish2 6

The output should be a list with the dishes sorted by total value of the dishes. 
Each line of this list will gather the equal dishes, display the amount of dishes
 order and the total. After all items, make a separator (e.g. ====================), 
 and add the following information value of the tab, value for each person.

Total $63
Total per person $31.5
